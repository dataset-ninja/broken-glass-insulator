The authors of the dataset constructed a database of broken glass insulators using a collection of Vietnamese public images from [various sources](https://github.com/phd-benel/VPMBGI). These images were captured during inspections of high voltage power lines by ground patrol agents, helicopters, and drones. After gathering the images, they carefully curated them to exclude irrelevant ones, focusing only on the ones of interest. Subsequently, they proceeded to label the defects present on the glass insulators using rectangular bounding boxes across all the images. Rigorous checks were performed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the labeling, ensuring that all cases of broken glass insulators were appropriately identified with precise bounding boxes encompassing each anomaly. 

The authors prioritized correctly delineating the anomalies to capture maximum spatial information. For this annotation work, they utilized the Roboflow platform and exported the results in Yolov7 annotation format. In the end, they curated a relatively small yet diverse dataset, comprising approximately 1010 images, which effectively represents the real-world deployment environment for broken glass insulators.
